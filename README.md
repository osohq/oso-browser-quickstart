This is a minimal example of how to use the oso javascript library in the browser with webpack.

`npm install` to install dependencies.
`npm run build` to build.
`npm run serve` to run a development server.

Then just navigate to localhost:8080/static/

See index.html for usage.

More docs coming soon.
